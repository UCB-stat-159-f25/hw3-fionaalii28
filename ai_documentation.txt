AI Tool Used: ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Purpose of Use:
ChatGPT was used as a support tool for clarification and debugging throughout the homework process. While the course website and lab materials (particularly Lab 7 and Lab 8) already provided clear guidance for setting up MyST, Binder, and GitHub Pages, certain steps in the workflow required additional explanation when errors or unexpected behavior occurred.

How It Was Used:
To clarify instructions and terminology from the homework description or MyST documentation.
To understand error messages and determine how to fix issues with myst.yml, binder links, or the Makefile.
To confirm best practices for structuring commits, writing test cases, and verifying MyST builds.
To troubleshoot runtime or dependency issues when certain steps (e.g., myst build --html or Binder rendering) were not running smoothly.
To ensure reproducibility and clarity, such as verifying that all notebook paths were correctly updated to use the data/, figures/, and audio/ folders.

Example Prompts / Inputs and Outputs:
Prompt: “My MyST site builds locally but the binder link doesn’t open — what does this mean and how do I fix it?”
Output: ChatGPT explained that Binder may still point to an older commit and suggested updating the myst.yml Binder URL or repushing recent changes to the repo.
Prompt: “Why does my Makefile return ‘no rule to make target env’?”
Output: ChatGPT clarified that Makefiles must be located in the project’s root directory and that the syntax of .PHONY targets should match the assignment structure.

Reflection:
The AI tool was mainly used for clarification and troubleshooting, not for writing code or solving statistical concepts. Most steps followed directly from course material and class demonstrations (especially Lab 7 on MyST setup). ChatGPT helped ensure a smooth workflow when errors occurred or when specific configurations needed to match course expectations. Overall, it was used as a learning and guidance resource, helping confirm understanding and resolve technical issues efficiently.
